Parallel Computing Project
The project consists of making use of multithreading by connecting two computers, one being the server and the other the client.
The project creates arrays of "n" by "n" defined by the user and filled automatically, where it shows how little time it can take with the use of multithreading.
It allows us to enter the IP of the server and shows us if the connection has been created correctly before running the program.

The system is implemented with: 
- Classes
- Attributes and Methods
- Objects 
- Constructors in each class. 
- Own methods.
- Parallel computing.
- Multithreading.
