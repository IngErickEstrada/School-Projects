Information Technology project developed on a Raspberry Pi 2B + with Python and Arduino.
The aim of the project is to create an embedded system that allows us to control different processes making the Raspberry as a server 
and sending the actions to the client that will be our Arduino.

The project is developed in three parts:
1) The first part is developed in HTML with CSS, which are views for the user to send the actions of the program, 
turning on a light bulb in a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, garage, etc, turn on the motion alarm or control the fan in the three programmed speeds. 
2) The second part is developed in Python, which receives the actions sent from the HTML views, where it saves the action that will later be sent to the Arduino.
3) And the third part is developed in Arduino where it reads the action sent from the server and interprets and makes the corresponding action 
such as turning on or off a lamp, turn on a fan controlled with speeds or turn on an alarm with motion detector.
